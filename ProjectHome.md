RPGFS is an experimental game that combines Linux filesystem commands with an RPG.  The filesystem is the environment, files are paths, bugs, and items.  The goal is to find a special file in the filesystem and remove it to enable a command to destroy the filesystem.  Available commands include cd (to navigate the filesystem), pwd, ls, cat (to inspect files) and rm (to remove/attack files).

Can't say it's enjoyable, but it was an idea I wanted to see in code.
